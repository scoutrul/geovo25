    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to work with you?",
      "answer": "It all depends on the scale of the task and needs. I work by the hour, with payment per volume or full-time contract: full flexibility and transparency. If it's about UX audit, redesign or full product design, I'll offer a range after a short call. My goal is for you to understand the budget upfront, without surprises and hidden fees"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we start with a small task?",
      "answer": "Of course. We can start with a pilot phase — for example, with redesigning one scenario, a landing page or UX audit. This will give you an understanding of the approach and quality of work without large investments. If everything suits you, we scale further"
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can we start?",
      "answer": "Usually within 1-3 days after discussing the task. I keep my schedule flexible to quickly get involved in work. Often within a week you have the first result in your hands"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work alone or do you have a team?",
      "answer": "I work alone, but if necessary I involve trusted colleagues — designers, analysts, illustrators or developers.\nYou still communicate directly with me, without layers and managers. This maintains quality control and speed of decisions"
    },
    {
      "question": "How are you different from an agency or hiring a designer in-house?",
      "answer": "Agencies often work by template and stretch communication. An in-house designer requires adaptation and strict management.\nWith me it's simpler: you communicate directly, decisions are made quickly, and the result is measurable — without loss of quality and structure"
    },
    {
      "question": "What guarantees do you give?",
      "answer": "I'm not about just \"beautiful design\". My goal is to improve product metrics: conversion, retention, user experience.\nI'm inspired by products where I can really influence metrics, and I support after implementation"
    },
    {
      "question": "Where are you and do you work with foreign companies?",
      "answer": "I'm in Bali, but I have extensive experience with businesses from CIS, USA and Europe. Online format, confident communication in English, payment in any currency or crypto. I always adapt to your time zone and meeting format"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you take on startups or large companies?",
      "answer": "Extensive experience with both. The main thing is that there is a clear product and goals that design can really help achieve.\nIn startups I often help build design and process from scratch, in mature companies — I optimize and develop"
